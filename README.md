# College Daddy

College Daddy is a comprehensive academic tool designed to simplify student life. It provides essential calculators, study resources, and productivity tools to help students efficiently manage their academics. Originally developed during the end-semester exams, this project was created to address common student challenges like note-sharing, internal marks calculation, and study organization.

## Why the Name Change?
The original name, "College Buddy," was not available as a domain, so we rebranded to "College Daddy" to maintain a unique identity while keeping the essence of an all-in-one academic companion.

## Features
- **CGPA Calculator**: Quickly estimate your CGPA based on your grades. If you enter your current SGPA and desired CGPA, the calculator will tell you how much SGPA is needed in each semester to reach your goal. It also suggests how many companies you may be eligible for during placements based on your CGPA.
- **Internal Marks Calculator**: Predict your internal marks and assess your academic standing. It also helps determine if you are eligible for the end-semester exam and calculates how many marks you need in the final exam to achieve your desired grade.
- **Notes Repository**: Access all 8 semesters of engineering notes in one place.
- **Pomodoro Study Timer**: Boost productivity with a built-in study timer designed for effective learning. It also includes built-in study music to help maintain focus.

## Why College Daddy?
Many students struggle with organizing and sharing notes, and traditional methods like Google Drive can be cumbersome. To solve this, College Daddy provides a structured platform for accessing and managing study materials. Additionally, students often find it difficult to calculate their internal marks, leading to uncertainty about their final grades. This tool integrates multiple solutions into one convenient platform, making it an all-in-one academic assistant.
